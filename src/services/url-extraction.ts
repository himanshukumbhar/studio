It's built on Google Cloud and powered by Codey, a family of foundation models from Google. Key features include AI-assisted code completion, chatbot assistance for answering questions, and adding contextual code actions like "add comments" and "add types". Project IDX also offers fully-configurable, Linux-based virtual machines in the cloud, with access to a terminal. For multiplatform development, it includes built-in iOS and Android simulators and a web preview, all available directly in the browser.`;
